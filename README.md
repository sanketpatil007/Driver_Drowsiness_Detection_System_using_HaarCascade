#Introduction
Drowsiness, defined as the state of sleepiness when one needs to rest, can cause symptoms that have great impact over the performance of tasks: slowed response time, intermittent lack of awareness, or microsleeps (blinks with a duration of over 500 ms), to name a few examples. In fact, continuous fatigue can cause levels of performance impairment similar to those caused by alcohol. While driving, these symptoms are extremely dangerous since they significantly increase the probabilities of drivers missing road signs or exits, drifting into other lanes or even crashing their vehicle, causing an accident.
